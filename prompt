I want to remove the nth node from the end of the linked list. 
What is wrong with the implementation? I believe it is failing in like the edge cases.

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        nth_node_after = head
        curr = head
        
        for i in range(n):
            nth_node_after = nth_node_after.next

        prev = None
        while nth_node_after != None:
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
            nth_node_after = nth_node_after.next

        if prev.next == None and curr and curr.next != None:
            prev.next = curr.next

        return head
